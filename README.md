# 🧠 INTUITION BEHIND ALGORITHMS  

🎯 A visual & intuitive journey into *Machine Learning algorithms* — not by memorizing formulas, but by feeling how they work.  

Each notebook here focuses on understanding the *mathematical logic, **visual explanation, and **step-by-step intuition* behind ML algorithms — from simple regression lines 📈 to complex decision trees 🌳 and neural networks 🧬.  

💡 The goal is simple: *learn ML by intuition, not by rote*.  
Because when you see how an algorithm behaves, you’ll never forget how it works. ✨

📚 Inside this repo, you’ll discover:  

- 🔢 *Regression algorithms* — from simple to multiple & polynomial  
- 🔁 *Classification models* — logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision trees  
- 🎲 *Naive Bayes* — intuition of conditional probabilities  
- 🌲 *Ensemble models* — random forest & boosting ideas  
- 🌀 *Clustering & PCA* — understanding shapes in data visually  
- ⚙ *Optimization* — how gradient descent learns  
- 🧮 *Feature engineering* — encoding, scaling, and selection  
- 🔍 *Model evaluation* — confusion matrix, cross-validation, ROC, and more

This isn’t a repository of code alone —  
it’s a *learning diary* 🗒 of how each algorithm feels and behaves.  
Every notebook blends *math + visualization + explanation* to make ML concepts stick permanently.  

Built using 🐍 *Python, 📊 **Matplotlib, 🧮 **NumPy, 🤖 **scikit-learn, and visualized interactively through **Jupyter/Colab notebooks*.

💭 I created this collection to strengthen my own intuition before moving into *Deep Learning* — because great ML engineers think in visuals, not equations alone.
